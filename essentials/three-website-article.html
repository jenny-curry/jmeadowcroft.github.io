                <h3> The Good #1</h3>

                 I really like this website becuasse of the movement that is in it. In particular, the stain glass that moves across the screen is really beautiful and so is rightfully an eye catcher. The cutout for this is curved and I think that this catches the viewer's eye beacuasue of its contrast to the other square contents on the page. The font that they use for titles is also eye catching, and it makes me want to read further, since it compliments the look of the website. The color scheme that is used also is friendlky to the viewer, the tan and ubrurn-red shade compliment each other very nicely. When inspecting the code used for this website, it looks very modern and clean. There are lots of div tags and ids, no tables. The layout makes sense and the user is able to scroll through the contents and navigate to a variety of pages easily. Like I said, the color is used effectively, with 4 major colors: red, blue, black, and tan. This website is very professional and definitley suits its audience. A nice effect of the website is that the date links light up underlined when hovered over with a mouse.

                <h3> The Good #2</h3>
                <a href="https://www.sscyril.org/">Saint Cyril's Catholic Church</a>

                 Overall, this is a really nice website. I really like this website's organizational structure, how there is a picture displayed at the top and then a list of events below with appropriate padding between elements. The code used on this website is very modern, with all sorts of containing elements on the home page. The page also uses several fonts, differentiating between those that are titles and are plain text. Additionally, When I scroll down, the menu bar at the top reverse the colors of background and foreground and sticks at the top of the page. Colors used are white, gray, yellow, and brown. This website could use a better pop of color, but these shades all work very well together. The layout makes sense, a tables is used but I am not quite sure how they are implementing it in the creation of this website. This website scrolls and I mentioned already the nice effect with the navigation bar. This website is very church like, amd also modern, so I think it is very appropraite for the purpose it serves.

                <h3> The Bad</h3>
                <a href="http://www.olvmt.org/">Our Lady of the Valley, Sacred Heart</a>

                 This website is not the cream of the crop. It seems dated and like not much time was invested in this websote as it seems bare, with lots of whote space. Looking at the code, I don't understand how the website is organized as there is akmost no code to look at. There is some attention to fonts, and someone decided the blue background color was the one that needed to go there, but doesn't exactly fit the theme of the website. Additionally, the website is not mobile accessible, it appears the user must have a large screen tp see what is going on. The picture of the church on the front page even is cut off, so I can't see the picture of the church. Colrs used in this website are white, blue, and black, wioth a little bit of red. This website is fitting, but unfortunately displays a older age of mass attenders, as it looks like someone with out much html and css experience coded this.
